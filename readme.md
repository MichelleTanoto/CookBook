# CookBook

This is a project I made after watching a 4 hours react-native crash course. I challenge myself to make this in 4 days and I managed to. There are features I haven't yet implement such as search feature and deletion feature but I am quite satisfied with this.

# How to Run
1. Clone/ download this project.
2. Download Expo App in your phone.
3. Open this project in your favorite IDE.
4. run `npm start` on the terminal. Make sure you are on the right directory.
5. It will direct you to a web page as shown below.

  if you see the IP address that is inside a black box, as I make this with expo I need to constantly change the port. In this way, go to `misc` folder and go to `port.js` file. Copy the IP address inside the black box and replace with PORT="[paste here]".
6. Scan the barcode with your phone camera.
